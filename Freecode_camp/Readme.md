Variable Naming
camel case for example: camelCase is best practice.
MYVARis not the same as MyVar or myvar. It is possible to have multiple distinct variables with the same name but different casing. It is strongly recommended that for the sake of clarity, you do not use this language feature.

Escape Characters

There are two reasons to use escaping characters: First is to allow you to use characters you might not otherwise be able to type out, such as a backspace. Second is to allow you to represent multiple quotes in a string without JavaScript misinterpreting what you mean. We learned this in the previous challenge.

Code	Output
\'	single quote
\"	double quote
\\	backslash
\n	newline
\r	carriage return
\t	tab
\b	backspace
\f	form feed
