Node is a Javascript engine build on C++.
ECMAscript is a specification and Javascript is a programming langauge.
Script tag is best to use at the end because the code is read top to bottom. Javascript code might heavy to load.
Separation of concerns is something that is used to separate different script files.

//Variables rules
Variables cannot be a reserved key word.
Variables name should be meaningful and descriptive.
Cannot start with a number(1name)
Cannot contain a space or hyphen(-).
Use camel notation. (firstname)
Variables are case sensitive.
Can define multiple variable in a single line and separate with commas.
Best practice is to define each variable in a single line.

If we need variables that values remains constant then we use const.

We have two different variables types.

1) Primitve types

String
Number
Boolean
Undefined 
Null

In Javascript there are no other kinds of number such as float or integer.

2) Reference types

a) Object
    Object is same as real life objects.
    Such as a person has name, address, age, phone Number, genedr and all.
    These are the properties of an object.
    Accessing and changing the variables has two ways.
    Dot notation and Bracket Notation.
    Usually it is best practice to use Dot Notation but Bracket Notation has its own use cases.
